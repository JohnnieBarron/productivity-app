The first step toward self-improvement and becoming your best self is setting a S.M.A.R.T. goal.
S.M.A.R.T. stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

I'll guide you through creating your first one. Let's begin with the first step: Specific.

Do you want your first goal to focus on improving your mind or your body?
(Don't worry if you have goals for both â€” you can always create more later!)

<form action="/user" method="POST">

    <label for="name">name your goal, remember to be 'Specific' but concise .<br>ex. lose 10lbs, Learn spanish:</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />

    <label for="Type">Goal type:</label>
           <select id="Type" name="Type">
            <option selected value="mind">Mind</option>
            <option value="body">Body</option>
        </select>


     <button type="submit">Add New goal</button>
</form>
